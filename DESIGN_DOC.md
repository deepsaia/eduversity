# eduversity in 60 Seconds

**What?**  
A K-12 learning platform where children master CBSE/Common Core standards by playing curriculum-aligned games ‚Äî while teachers get real-time analytics and parents receive Hindi/English progress reports.

**Why?**  
- Significant numbers of students in the US are not performing on grade level, with approximately 44% of public school students starting the 2023-24 year behind in at least one subject.
- Because 78% of Indian students are ‚Äúin school but not learning‚Äù (ASER 2022). Interactive apps and games boost engagement; structure ensures mastery.
- There are no specific figures for the entire UK, but in February 2024, 20.53% of children in England failed to attend school regularly.

**How?**  
- üéÆ 2,000+ games (Unity + Python Arcade) for Math, Science, English.
- üìö Drag-and-drop course blueprints aligned to CBSE, NCERT, Common Core.
- üìä AI-powered insights: ‚ÄúAssign ‚ÄòDecimal Dungeon‚Äô to Priya ‚Äî she‚Äôs struggling.‚Äù
- üåê Works offline, on low-end phones, in Hindi & English.

**For Whom?**  
Students (joyful learning), Teachers (less grading, more teaching), Parents (peace of mind), Schools (ready-to-deploy).

**Impact:**  
Pilot data: 23% higher test scores with 2x/week gameplay.

**Get Started:**  
Open Source for all.

## 0. Why eduversity? The Learning Revolution <a name="why"></a>

> ‚ÄúEducation shouldn‚Äôt feel like work. It should feel like discovery.‚Äù

While platforms like Moodle offer structure and Legends of Learning offer engagement, **eduversity fuses both into a single, adaptive, joyful learning universe** ‚Äî where a child in Mumbai masters fractions by battling space pirates, while their teacher in Manchester tracks real-time mastery analytics, and their parent in Delhi receives a Hindi progress report via WhatsApp.

**Our North Star:**  
> *Every child deserves a personalized, game-powered, curriculum-aligned learning journey ‚Äî no matter their language, location, or device.*

**Core Differentiators:**
- üéÆ **Play-to-Learn Engine**: Not ‚Äúgames as rewards‚Äù ‚Äî games *as the core pedagogy*, mapped to CBSE, Common Core, NGSS.
- üåê **Truly Bilingual**: Not just UI translation ‚Äî culturally adapted content, examples, and voiceovers in Hindi & English.
- üß© **Lego-Block Curriculum**: Teachers assemble courses like LEGO ‚Äî drag-and-drop blueprints, auto-aligned to standards.
- üìä **Insight, Not Just Data**: AI doesn‚Äôt grade ‚Äî it *recommends*. ‚ÄúPriya struggled with decimals ‚Üí assign ‚ÄòDecimal Dungeon‚Äô Level 2.‚Äù
- üè´ **School-Ready Out-of-the-Box**: Pre-loaded with 500+ games, 1000+ lessons, zero setup for CBSE Grade 6 Math or NGSS Grade 8 Science.

* Build an intuitive, secure, and scalable LMS for K‚Äì12 that:

  * Is ready out-of-the-box with grade-level content (US: Common Core/UK: KS / India: CBSE/NCERT).
  * Ships with a catalogue of interactive apps and Unity WebGL games for learning (core differentiation).
  * Exposes a clean, object-oriented backend API (FastAPI + Pydantic + SQLAlchemy) enabling easy extension.
  * Is deployable to single schools, multi-school districts, and nation-wide institutions (multi-tenant).
  * Deeply supports English and Hindi localization for UI and curriculum content.

**Primary success metrics:** teacher adoption, student engagement (DAU/MAU), percent course completion, grade improvement, content author re-use, institution deployments.

---

## 2. Personas & Roles <a name="personas"></a>

## 6. Core Concepts & Data Model (object-oriented) <a name="datamodel"></a>

### Key domain objects (OOP-style):

* `User` (id, name, email, roles, institution\_id)
* `Institution` (id, name, tenant\_config, theme)
* `Course` (id, title, description, format, curriculum\_tags\[], instructor\_ids\[], catalog\_id)
* `Module` (id, course\_id, title, position, release\_rules)
* `Lesson` (id, module\_id, content\_items\[])
* `ContentItem` (abstract) -> `TextContent`, `VideoContent`, `QuizContent`, `AppContent`, `FileContent`, `H5PContent`
* `Quiz` / `Question` / `QuestionBankItem`
* `Assignment` (rubric\_id, due\_date, submissions\[])
* `Submission` (id, assignment\_id, student\_id, files, grade, feedback)
* `Gradebook` / `GradeEntry`
* `ProgressRecord` (user\_id, content\_id, status, score, timestamp)
* `AppManifest` (for Unity or Arcade apps) ‚Äì metadata for plugin manager
* `Event` (actor\_id, action, object\_type, object\_id, metadata) ‚Äî used for analytics/events

### Mermaid Class Diagram (high-level)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User{
      +UUID id
      +string name
      +string email
      +List~Role~ roles
    }
    class Course{
      +UUID id
      +string title
      +string format
    }
    class Module{
      +UUID id
      +int position
    }
    class Lesson{

    }
    class ContentItem{
      <<abstract>>
      +UUID id

    User "1" --> "*" Course : instructorOf
    Course "1" --> "*" Module : has
    Module "1" --> "*" Lesson : has
    Lesson "1" --> "*" ContentItem : contains
```

### Persistence guidelines

* Use SQLAlchemy ORM with migrations (Alembic).
* Model design favors composition ‚Äî `ContentItem` polymorphism via `content_type` discriminator column.
* Use `JSONB` fields (Postgres) for flexible metadata for content manifests, app settings, and conditional rules.

## 7. Course Blueprints, Catalogs & CoursePaths <a name="courses"></a>

The Eduverse platform organizes educational content through structured blueprints, centralized catalogs, and adaptive learning paths (CoursePaths). This ensures consistency across schools, subjects, and grade levels, while supporting personalization.

### 7.1 Course Blueprints

* **Definition:** Blueprints are JSON/YAML-based templates describing the structure of a course.
* **Elements:**

  * Metadata: Title, Subject, Grade level, Difficulty rating.
  * Content blocks: Videos, 3D interactive modules, quizzes, text lessons.
  * Assessment model: Formative (in-lesson quizzes), Summative (end-of-course tests).
  * Gamification hooks: XP, badges, leaderboards.
  * Accessibility flags: Language support, audio descriptions.
* **Reusability:** A blueprint can be cloned and adapted for different curricula (e.g., Common Core vs CBSE).

### 7.2 Course Catalogs

* **Centralized Repository:**

  * All blueprints are stored in a searchable catalog.
  * Indexed by subject, grade, skill tags, and learning outcomes.
* **Access Controls:**

  * Teachers: Can create and publish.
  * Students: Can only enroll and consume.
  * Admins: Can curate, approve, or restrict visibility.
* **Versioning:**

  * Each course has semantic versioning (e.g., `Math101 v2.1`).
  * Deprecated versions remain accessible for audit/record purposes.

### 7.3 CoursePaths

* **Definition:** CoursePaths represent learner journeys across multiple blueprints.
* **Adaptive Learning:**

  * Based on performance and preferences, learners are guided to remedial or advanced modules.
  * Example: Failing Algebra I module ‚Üí recommended remedial practice before progressing to Algebra II.
* **Progression Models:**

  * Linear: Complete all modules in sequence.
  * Branching: Choice-driven progression (STEM electives vs Arts electives).
  * Mastery-based: Cannot proceed unless a skill is mastered (‚â•80% proficiency).
* **Visual Representation:** CoursePaths are rendered as a **skill tree** inside the Eduverse dashboard.

### 7.4 Example JSON Snippet (Course Blueprint)

```json
{
  "courseId": "math101",
  "title": "Introduction to Algebra",
  "grade": 8,
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "modules": [
    { "id": "m1", "title": "Variables & Expressions", "type": "video" },
    { "id": "m2", "title": "Equations Basics", "type": "quiz", "passScore": 70 },
    { "id": "m3", "title": "Graphing", "type": "interactive3D" }
  ],
  "assessment": {
    "type": "summative",
    "finalExam": true,
    "passingCriteria": 75
  },
  "gamification": {
    "xpPerModule": 100,
    "badges": ["Algebra Novice", "Equation Solver"]
  }
}
```

### 7.5 Example CoursePath Visualization (Mermaid)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Math Basics] --> B[Algebra I]
    B --> C[Algebra II]
    C --> D[Geometry]
    B --> E[Remedial Algebra]
    E --> B
```

### 7.6 Benefits

* Teachers can rapidly assemble courses from modular blueprints.
* Students experience **adaptive, gamified learning paths**.
* Admins maintain oversight via catalogs, ensuring compliance and quality control.

| prerequisites            | array of content ids         | links to prior items or standards                                                                                |
| learning\_outcomes       | array                        | short statements, localized                                                                                      |
| license                  | string                       | `CC-BY`, `All-Rights-Reserved`, institution-specific                                                             |
| visibility               | enum                         | `draft`, `in_review`, `published`, `deprecated`, `archived`                                                      |
| authors                  | array                        | list of user ids and roles (author, reviewer)                                                                    |
| version                  | semver/string                | versioning for content packages and apps                                                                         |
| assets                   | array                        | references to stored files (S3 keys)                                                                             |

| created\_at, updated\_at | timestamps                   | audit fields                                                                                                     |

**Design note:** store `title` and `description` as a small i18n map to make translation and fallback logic explicit. Use a `metadata` JSONB property for arbitrary, content-specific configuration (e.g., quiz timer settings, or Unity app settings).

### 8.2 Editorial Workflow & States

A lightweight editorial workflow supports collaborative authoring:

* **Draft** ‚Äî authoring state. Not visible to students.
* **In Review** ‚Äî author requests peer or content admin review.
* **QA** ‚Äî QA checks (accessibility, standards mapping, playtests). Optional automated QA checks run here.
* **Approved** ‚Äî ready to publish; an approver signs off.
* **Published** ‚Äî visible per permissions to target users/tenants/catalogs.
* **Deprecated/Archived** ‚Äî retain history; cannot appear in new course blueprints.

**Workflow actions:** `request_review`, `approve`, `publish`, `deprecate`, `archive`, `rollback(version)`.

### 8.3 Authoring UX & Tooling

* **WYSIWYG editor** supporting rich text, embedded media and interactive H5P/iframe components.
* **App Embed Flow:** Authors add an `app_manifest` pointer (choose from marketplace) and configure run-time parameters (difficulty, lives, scoring rules).
* **Localization Panel:** side-by-side editors to translate title/desc and in-content text.
* **Preview Mode:** preview as student (child view) or teacher (with instructor overlays).
* **Accessibility Checker:** reports on image alt text, headings, reading order and color contrast.
* **Automated QA:** run accessibility checks, broken-link checks, file type validation, SCORM validation.

### 8.4 Versioning, Snapshots & Diff

* Every publish event creates an immutable **snapshot** (content\_version) that stores pointers to assets and a checksum.
* Support `diff` between versions: textual diff for HTML/text; asset diffs for videos and apps (list of changed asset keys).
* `rollback` operation creates a new snapshot that is exact copy of a previous published version and marks the previous as superseded.

### 8.5 Storage & Delivery

* Use **S3/MinIO**-style object store for large assets; store small structured content in DB (Postgres JSONB) with asset pointers.
* Enable per-tenant buckets or prefixes for multi-tenancy.
* CDN fronting for all heavy assets (Unity WebGL builds, video segments).
* Support chunked/resumable uploads for unstable networks.

### 8.6 Search & Discovery

* Index content in ElasticSearch/OpenSearch.
* Provide faceted search: `grade`, `subject`, `language`, `difficulty`, `standard_codes`, `estimated_time`.
* Provide semantic search and recommendations in a later phase (embedding-based search powered by vector DB like Chroma or pgvector).

**Suggested ES Mapping (high-level):** index `title`, `description`, `curriculum_tags` as keywords, `locale_title` as text with language analyzers for `en` and `hi`.

### 8.7 Content Security & Sandbox

* Apps run in secure iframes with `CSP` and `sandbox` attributes.
* App-player message protocol limits scope of actions: only `progress` and `score` events allowed. Apps cannot access cookies or DOM of parent.
* Validate app manifests on submission; require a security checklist for external publishers.

## 9. Assessment, Grading & Analytics ‚Äî Detailed Design <a name="assessment"></a>

This section expands grading and analytics with concrete data flows, schemas (conceptual), reporting needs, and item-level psychometrics.

### 9.1 Assessment Types & Models

* **Formative quizzes:** auto-graded, instant feedback.
* **Summative tests:** time-boxed, proctoring optional (third-party services), closed-book options.
* **Assignments:** file submissions, inline text, links to repo or Google Drive.
* **Peer Review:** configurable reviewers, rubrics.
* **Projects:** multi-part submissions, group-based grading.
* **Adaptive Assessments:** future ‚Äî item selection based on previous responses.

### 9.2 Gradebook Model

`GradeEntry` captures: `student_id`, `course_id`, `item_id`, `item_type`, `raw_score`, `max_score`, `weight`, `grade_scale`, `graded_by`, `comment`, `timestamp`.

* Allow grade aggregation per teacher-configured weights; support grade visibility toggles per-item.
* Parent view shows aggregated grade and interpreted guidance (e.g., below/at/above expectations) rather than raw percentages.

### 9.3 Rubrics & Marking

* Rubrics are structured JSON describing criteria and levels. Each criterion has descriptors and point values.
* Inline annotation tools for teachers (PDF & image annotation integrations).

### 9.4 Psychometrics & Item Analytics

* Compute *p-value* (difficulty) for quiz items: proportion correct among tested students.
* Compute *discrimination* index: correlation between item score and total test score.
* Flag items for review when p < 0.2 or extremely discriminating/uninformative.

### 9.5 Learning Progress & Mastery Tracking

* `ProgressRecord` per user per objective records `status` (`not_started`, `in_progress`, `mastered`, `needs_review`) with timestamps.
* Support competency-based progression: lessons unlocked by mastery rather than time.

### 9.6 Reports & Dashboards

* **Student dashboard:** upcoming deadlines, progress bars, recent scores, time-on-task.
* **Teacher dashboard:** at-risk students, average scores by question, question-level analytics, app/game analytics.
* **Parent dashboard:** monthly summary, skills snapshot, recommended actions.

### 9.7 Data Pipeline for Analytics

* Event stream (Kafka/Redis Streams) captures every interaction; consumer jobs aggregate into analytic tables (ClickHouse or materialized views in Postgres).
* Use scheduled ETL jobs to compute psychometric metrics nightly.

**Privacy note:** All reports for minors should aggregate or anonymize data when exported outside the tenant.

## 10. Messaging, Notifications & Collaboration ‚Äî Expanded <a name="messaging"></a>

### 10.1 Internal Messaging

* Threaded conversations scoped to course, group or global.
* Rich messages (attachments, mentions, emoji, localized content).
* Message retention policy configurable by institution.

### 10.2 Forum & Wiki

* Per-course forums with categories and moderation tools.
* Wiki pages versioned; allow teacher or student contributions with a review step.

### 10.3 Real-time Communication

* WebSocket gateway (FastAPI + Redis Pub/Sub) for low-latency chat and presence.
* Optionally integrate Matrix or use hosted Jitsi for teleconferencing via LTI/iframe.

### 10.4 Notifications

* Notification channels: in-app, email, web-push. Configurable by user.
* Event types: `assignment_due`, `grade_posted`, `app_suggestion`, `forum_reply`.

### 10.5 Moderation & Safety

* Keyword filters, content moderation queue, manual review workflows.
* Abuse reporting and user ban/unban flows.

---

## 11. Integrations & Standards ‚Äî Practical Details <a name="standards"></a>

### 11.1 LTI 1.3 / Advantage

* eduverse can be both an LTI tool provider and consumer.
* App manifests register LTI credentials (client id, JWKS keys) and specify launch\_url and deep-linking support.

### 11.2 SCORM & H5P

* Implement a SCORM runtime shim to host SCORM 1.2/2004 packages (limit complexities; support most learning objects).
* Provide an H5P runtime and authoring bridge; store H5P content as first-class content packages.

### 11.3 xAPI (Tin Can)

* Accept xAPI statements from apps; optionally forward them to a configured LRS.
* Map key events to xAPI verbs and objects. Example statement:

```json
{
  "actor": {"mbox": "mailto:student1@example.com", "name": "Student 1"},
  "verb": {"id": "http://adlnet.gov/expapi/verbs/completed", "display": {"en-US": "completed"}},
  "object": {"id": "https://eduverse.example.com/apps/math-safari/level/3", "definition": {"name": {"en-US": "Level 3 - Math Safari"}}},
  "result": {"score": {"scaled": 0.8, "raw": 80, "min": 0, "max": 100}, "duration": "PT5M30S"},
  "timestamp": "2025-09-21T10:15:00Z"
}
```

### 11.4 OneRoster / SIS

* Support roster sync and grade sync via OneRoster CSV or OneRoster API.
* Account for mapping of sections/classes to course instances.

---

## 12. Plugin (as services) & Game/App Architecture (Unity/WebGL + Python Arcade) <a name="plugins"></a>

eduverse treats plugins (games/apps/tools) as **first-class services** with a well-defined lifecycle: *submit ‚Üí validate ‚Üí vet/test ‚Üí publish ‚Üí run-time telemetry*. Plugins live in the *marketplace* and are executed in secure sandboxes.

### 12.1 Plugin-as-Service Concept

* A plugin is *not* arbitrary code executed on platform servers. Instead, it is a cataloged, versioned artifact (WebGL build, JS/WASM bundle, iframe endpoint) that runs on clients within an iframe and communicates through a limited, authenticated API.
* Each plugin is paired with a **Plugin Service** for developer workflows: manifest hosting, validation, telemetry ingestion (xAPI), and a sandbox environment.

### 12.2 Lifecycle & Roles

* **Developer**: submits plugin manifest + assets.
* **Plugin Service**: validates manifest; runs automated checks and reports results.
* **Content Admin**: reviews and approves for institutional marketplaces.
* **eduverse Marketplace**: lists certified plugins with permissions and pricing metadata (if applicable).

### 12.3 Runtime Model ‚Äî Unity WebGL

* Unity builds are precompiled into a directory with `index.html`, `Build/*.data`, `Build/*.wasm`, `Build/*.js`.
* Uploads are stored in tenant bucket, versioned; CDN distributes assets.
* The *player* loads the `index.html` in an iframe. Parent page provides a secure JWT via postMessage during an initial handshake.

**Handshake**

1. Parent creates a short-lived signed token: `{sub: user_id, env: tenant_id, scope: ['progress:write','state:read'], exp: ISO}`.
2. Parent `postMessage` `eduverse:auth` token to iframe origin.
3. App verifies token server-side via introspection endpoint (apps optionally register an introspection URL) or verify signature client-side if key is available.

**Data flow**

* App ‚Üí Parent: `eduverse:progress` and `eduverse:score` messages (postMessage JSON). Parent validates origin & payload and writes events to Event Bus.
* Parent ‚Üí App: `eduverse:config`, `eduverse:restore_state`.

### 12.4 Runtime Model ‚Äî Python Arcade (lightweight)

* Arcade games compiled/packaged into JS/WASM via Pyodide or similar toolchain and shipped as small bundles.
* Same iframe-based execution model with identical messaging spec.

### 12.5 App Message Schema (strict)

**App ‚Üí Parent (example):**

```json
{
  "event": "eduverse:score",
  "payload": {"score": 82, "max_score": 100, "level": 3, "duration_ms": 312000},
  "meta": {"app_id":"math-safari-001","session_id":"...","ts":"2025-09-21T10:15:00Z"}
}
```

**Parent ‚Üí App (example):**

```json
{
  "event": "eduverse:auth",
  "payload": {"token":"ey...","user": {"id":"u123","role":"student"}},
  "meta": {"ts":"2025-09-21T10:14:45Z"}
}
```

### 12.6 App Telemetry & xAPI

* Apps must emit xAPI-compatible statements or the platform converts app event messages into xAPI statements. Statements are stored in an LRS or forwarded.
* Example mapping: `level_complete` ‚Üí verb `completed`; `hint_used` ‚Üí verb `interacted` with extension `hint_type`.

### 12.7 Security & Sandboxing

* All iframes loaded with `sandbox` attributes and `CSP` that restrict scripts and network unless explicitly allowed.
* Parent validates message `origin` and message signature (HMAC where needed).
* No direct parent DOM access; no cookie sharing.
* Verify uploaded assets for malware, ensure app size and runtime memory budgets.

### 12.8 App Marketplace APIs

* `POST /api/v1/plugins` ‚Äî submit manifest + assets (dev sandbox)
* `GET /api/v1/plugins/:id` ‚Äî plugin metadata
* `POST /api/v1/plugins/:id/validate` ‚Äî run validation
* `POST /api/v1/plugins/:id/publish` ‚Äî request listing
* `POST /api/v1/plugins/:id/telemetry` ‚Äî ingest telemetry xAPI statements

---

## 13. Security, AuthN/AuthZ & Multi-tenancy (complete spec)

eduverse security model emphasizes *principle of least privilege*, auditable policies, and flexible tenancy modes.

### 13.1 Authentication (AuthN) <a name="authn"></a>

Supported methods:

* Local email/password (bcrypt/argon2 hashed)
* OAuth2 / OIDC (Google, Microsoft)
* SAML 2.0 for institutional SSO
* Passwordless / magic link (email)
* 2FA (TOTP or SMS via provider)

**Session model:** access tokens (JWT) with short TTL + refresh tokens stored securely; cookies flagged `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, same-site as appropriate.

### 13.2 Authorization (AuthZ)

* **OpenFGA** backed RBAC/ABAC: policies stored in OpenFGA store; microservices call OpenFGA for authorization decisions.
* Resource model example: `fga:object/course:course-uuid#instructor`.
* Policy examples:

  * `can_edit_course(user, course) = user.role == 'teacher' && OpenFGA::is('instructor_of', user, course)`
  * `can_view_grade(user, grade) = (user == grade.student) || (OpenFGA::is('instructor_of', user, grade.course)) || (OpenFGA::is('parent_of', user, grade.student))`

### 13.3 Tenancy Modes

* **Single-tenant:** single institution deployment; simplest schema.
* **Shared-schema multi-tenant:** `tenant_id` column in key tables; lightweight & cost-efficient.
* **Schema-per-tenant:** separate DB schema per tenant for isolation.
* **Cluster-per-tenant:** full isolation for regulated customers (option for enterprise).

Tenant selection config provides per-tenant settings: default language, payment, SSO config, storage bucket, export policies.

### 13.4 Data Security & Privacy

* Encrypt PII fields at rest with per-tenant key management (KMS).
* Field-level access controls for sensitive data (SSNs, family contacts).
* Data retention and deletion workflows (GDPR/Indian privacy compliance).
* Parental consent artifacts required for minors; store signed consent with timestamp and device metadata.

### 13.5 Audit & Compliance

* Immutable audit logs for admin actions, exportable per tenant.
* Regular security scans: SAST, DAST, dependency vulnerability scanning.
* Pen-testing cadence & bug-bounty for major customers.

### 13.6 Child Safety & Ethical AI Charter

**Via Open Source Platform, We Ensure:**
> *No child‚Äôs data is ever sold. No child is ever pushed to ‚Äúplay more.‚Äù Learning is joyful ‚Äî not addictive.*

**Concrete Safeguards:**
- **No Behavioral Ads**: Zero third-party trackers. Games recommend *learning paths*, not products.
- **Playtime Limits**: Auto-pauses after 45 mins with: ‚ÄúGreat focus! Time for a break üå≥‚Äù
- **Parental Controls**: Set daily limits, disable chat, approve friend requests.
- **AI Ethics Board**: External advisors review recommendation algorithms quarterly for bias (e.g., ‚ÄúDoes the system favor urban students?‚Äù).
- **COPPA++ Compliance**: Beyond legal minimums ‚Äî ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù for minors, encrypted chat, human moderation.

**Transparency:**
- **Student Data Report**: Every parent receives a plain-English PDF: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs what we collected, why, and how to delete it.‚Äù
- **Algorithmic Audits**: Publish annual ‚ÄúImpact Report‚Äù showing: ‚ÄúOur math recommendations improved scores by X% without increasing screen time.‚Äù

> *We don‚Äôt just comply with privacy laws. We redefine what ‚Äúsafe‚Äù means for digital learning.*

---

## 14. Observability, Logging & Monitoring (concrete plan) <a name="observability"></a>

eduverse must be observable at request, event, and trace level.

### 14.1 Tracing

* Use **OpenTelemetry** to instrument FastAPI, background workers, and plugin ingestion endpoints.
* Trace sample flow: `student_open_lesson -> iframe_load -> app:init -> app:score -> event_ingest -> progress_update`.
* Backend traces exported to **Jaeger** (dev) and to vendor or self-hosted tracing in prod.

### 14.2 Metrics

* Collect Prometheus-compatible metrics: http\_request\_duration\_seconds, event\_ingest\_rate, worker\_queue\_size, plugin\_validation\_time, app\_launch\_count.
* SLO examples:

  * API latency p95 < 500ms
  * Event ingest availability >= 99.9%

### 14.3 Logging

* Structured JSON logs via **Loguru**, forwarded to Loki/Elasticsearch.
* Log enrichment: request\_id, trace\_id, tenant\_id, user\_id (when available), service.
* Retention: short-term hot logs (30 days), cold storage archived to S3 for 1 year (configurable per tenant).

### 14.4 Application Performance Monitoring (APM)

* Integrate APM to capture slow endpoints, database call heatmaps, failed jobs.
* Alert rules on spikes (error rates > threshold), queue backlogs.

### 14.5 Analytics Data Pipeline

* Event bus (Kafka or Redis Streams) + stream processors (Flink/ksqlDB or custom workers) ‚Üí analytical store (ClickHouse or materialized Postgres tables) for dashboards.
* Nightly jobs compute psychometrics and student-level aggregates; memoize expensive computations.

---

## 15. Backup, Export / Import, & Bulk Operations (operational playbook) <a name="ops"></a>

### 15.1 Backup Strategy

* Postgres: continuous WAL archiving + point-in-time restore (PITR) + nightly snapshots.
* Object storage (S3): object versioning enabled; lifecycle rules for old assets.
* Plugin assets: keep last N published versions; archive older versions.
* Test restores monthly to validate backups.

### 15.2 Export & Import Formats

* **Course Export:** JSON bundle with course metadata, module/lesson structure, references to asset manifest (zip of referenced assets optionally included).
* **SCORM/H5P:** support for import/export ‚Äì maintain mapping of SCORM modules to internal lesson IDs.
* **User/Roster Import:** CSV + OneRoster API. Provide dry-run validation.

### 15.3 Bulk Operations

* Implement asynchronous bulk jobs for: user imports, mass enrollments, bulk publish, bulk content retire.
* Provide a UI for job submission + monitoring with logs and error reports.

### 15.4 Disaster Recovery (DR)

* RTO & RPO targets defined per customer tier. Example: RTO = 4 hours for standard tenant, RPO = 15 minutes via WAL archiving.
* Runbook steps documented for common DR scenarios (DB failover, CDN corruption).

---

## 16. Scalability & Deployment Blueprint <a name="scalability"></a>

### 16.1 Environments

* **Local Dev**: Docker Compose (Postgres, Redis, MinIO, FastAPI, React Dev Server).
* **Staging**: Kubernetes single cluster with shared infra and realistic data.
* **Production**: Kubernetes with autoscaling, managed DBs, regional CDNs.

### 16.2 Kubernetes Topology (prod)

* Namespaces: `eduverse-core`, `eduverse-workers`, `tenant-<id>` (if schema-per-tenant), `infra`.
* Services: API gateways (ingress Nginx or cloud ALB), internal services (content-service, auth-service), workers (Celery/Kue), event brokers (Kafka), tracing (Jaeger), metrics (Prometheus), logging (Loki).

### 16.3 Horizontal Scaling Points

* API layer: scale replicas behind load balancer.
* Workers: scale based on queue length.
* Database: Postgres primary + read replicas; use partitioning for large tables (events, telemetry).
* CDN: Unity WebGL & video assets distributed via CDN edge.

### 16.4 Cost-saving & Edge Strategies

* Tiered asset delivery for low-bandwidth regions: offer low-resolution builds and smaller math-app bundles.
* Serverless functions for sporadic tasks (thumbnail generation) to reduce baseline infra cost.

### 16.5 CI/CD

* GitHub Actions / GitLab CI: tests ‚Üí security scans ‚Üí build ‚Üí publish images ‚Üí helm upgrade.
* Canary deploys for critical services.

### 16.6 `[Optional]` Deployment Models for Schools

| Model          | Description                                                                 | Ideal For                     |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Cloud SaaS** | Fully hosted, zero IT overhead. Pay per student/month.                      | Private schools, urban districts |
| **On-Prem Lite** | Docker container on school server. Syncs with cloud for updates/analytics. | Govt schools with intermittent internet |
| **USB Edition** | Entire grade‚Äôs content on USB. Works offline. Syncs via monthly ‚Äúdata courier.‚Äù | Rural schools, no internet    |
| **Govt Partnership** | White-labeled for state education boards. Pre-loaded on state tablets.      | State-wide rollouts (e.g., DIKSHA++) |

### 16.7 `[Optional]` Monetization & Sustainability

**Freemium Model:**
- **Free Tier**: Access to 30% of games, basic gradebook, 1 course blueprint.
- **Teacher Pro ($5/month)**: All games, advanced analytics, custom blueprints.
- **School License ($3/student/year)**: SSO, bulk enrollment, admin dashboards, priority support.
- **District/State Contract**: Custom content, API integrations, dedicated instance.

**Non-Profit Path:**
- Partner with NGOs (Pratham, Akshaya Patra) for subsidized rural deployments.
- ‚ÄúSponsor a School‚Äù program: Corporates fund licenses for under-resourced schools.

> *Revenue funds more games. More games drive adoption. Adoption improves learning. A virtuous cycle.*

---

## 17. Tech Stack & Tools ‚Äî Finalized and Opinionated <a name="techstack"></a>

### 17.1 Summary (stack by concern)

* **API / Backend**: FastAPI + Pydantic (typing & validation), SQLAlchemy (ORM), Alembic (migrations). Use Loguru for structured logging.
* **Auth & AuthZ**: OAuth2/OIDC + SAML connectors (for SSO); OpenFGA for authorization (relationship-based policies).
* **Workers & Tasks**: Celery (Redis) or RQ for simpler needs; choose Celery for advanced retries and scheduling.
* **Frontend**: React + Vite + Yarn; Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui; use react-i18next for i18n.
* **Games/Apps**: Unity WebGL (heavy games) + Python Arcade compiled to WebAssembly/JS for lightweight experiences.
* **Search & Discovery**: OpenSearch/Elastic for faceted search; optionally add vector search later (pgvector/Chroma) for semantic search.
* **Eventing / Telemetry**: Kafka (prod) / Redis Streams (small installs).
* **Analytics / OLAP**: ClickHouse (large installs) or Postgres materialized views for mid-size deployments.
* **Storage**: Postgres (transactional) + S3/MinIO (object assets).
* **Observability**: OpenTelemetry (traces) ‚Üí Jaeger; Prometheus (metrics) ‚Üí Grafana; structured logs ‚Üí Loki/Elastic.
* **CI/CD & Infra**: Docker, Helm charts & Kubernetes (K8s); GitHub Actions or GitLab CI; Terraform for infra provisioning (optional).
* **Standards & Interop**: LTI 1.3, SCORM 1.2/2004, xAPI/TinCan, OneRoster.
* **Code quality & Tooling**: ruff (linting), mypy (typing), pytest (testing), uv (packaging), pre-commit hooks.

### 17.2 Rationale & Tradeoffs

* FastAPI provides rapid development, first-class async support and OpenAPI generation‚Äîideal for a data-driven platform. SQLAlchemy is mature and portable across Postgres/SQLite for dev.
* Kafka is recommended when many events must be retained and replayed for analytics; Redis Streams is simpler for single-school deployments.
* ClickHouse becomes essential when event volume grows (millions of app events/day) ‚Äî otherwise Postgres analytical tables are fine.
* Unity gives best authoring & tooling for K‚Äì12 games; WebGL build size must be managed and served via CDN.

### 17.3 Managed vs Self-hosted Guidance

* **Start small**: Postgres (managed), MinIO, Redis (managed), and OpenSearch for search. Use managed Kafka (MSK) only at scale.
* **Cost/Complexity**: Use cloud managed RDS + S3 + managed Redis to reduce ops burden. Consider Elastic Cloud for search if budgets allow.

### 17.4 Minimal Dev Toolchain

* Local: Docker Compose with Postgres, Redis, MinIO, OpenSearch, and mailbox simulator.
* Lint/test: pre-commit (ruff, black-like), mypy, pytest.
* Local-run scripts and `make` targets: `make dev`, `make test`, `make lint`.

‚îî‚îÄ tooling/                   # scripts for dev & release
```

### 18.2 Service boundaries & ownership

* Each `service/*` is a small bounded context with its own tests, CI job and Dockerfile.
* Shared libraries (auth, db models, utils) live under `services/common` with semantic versioning.
* APIs communicate via well-defined REST or gRPC interfaces; event bus for high-volume async flows.

### 18.3 Development conventions

* **API layer** thin: controllers/routers call into `domain` services.
* **Domain layer** contains business rules and orchestration ‚Äî fully unit-testable.
* **Repository layer** handles DB operations; abstracted via interfaces for easier testing.
* **Naming**: use `snake_case` for DB & python, `kebab-case` for URLs, `camelCase` for JS objects.
* **Branching & Releases**: trunk-based development with short-lived feature branches, PR reviews, and semantic versioned releases (vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).

### 18.4 CI/CD Best Practices

* Per-service pipelines: `lint -> unit tests -> integration tests -> build image -> security scan -> push image -> deploy (staging)`.
* Canary or blue/green deploys for API changes.
* Use feature flags to gate major UX or platform features.

## 19. UX / UI Design Guidelines (kids-first, accessibility) <a name="ux"></a>

### 19.1 Overarching Principles

* **Simplicity for students**: minimal options per screen, predictable navigation, consistent affordances.
* **Progress visibility**: always display a clear progress indicator and the next suggested action.
* **Empowering teachers**: dense data surfaces with filters, bulk actions, and export capabilities.
* **Respecting parents**: digestible summaries and recommended actions (no jargon).

### 19.2 Visual System & Component Rules

* **Design tokens**: single source for colors, spacing, type scale, and radii; 2 themes (`kid`, `pro`).
* **Color & contrast**: meet WCAG AA for critical text; run contrast checks in the build.
* **Type scale**: body text minimum 16px; large headings for children screens.
* **Iconography**: consistent, friendly, culturally neutral icons; prefer illustration for kid-facing cues.

### 19.3 Accessibility (WCAG & A11Y)

* Keyboard navigable UI, ARIA labels, semantic HTML.
* Captions & transcripts for videos; alternative content for H5P interactivity.
* Provide an accessibility mode with larger fonts, reduced motion and high-contrast palette.

### 19.4 Localization & Content Guidelines

* All copy externalized (i18n keys); translators-only view in authoring app.
* Provide example content localizations for India (Hindi), including culturally appropriate names & examples.

### 19.5 Kids UX Patterns

* **Tight microcopy**: small, clear sentences; use icons and short prompts.
* **Affordances**: large tappable areas (>44px) and large visual buttons for core flows.
* **Feedback**: instant, positive feedback; celebrate small wins with subtle animation.
* **Session timeout handling**: warn gently and autosave game state or progress.

### 19.6 Teacher & Admin UX

* **Bulk workflows**: multi-select, bulk grade, bulk enroll.
* **Grading UX**: quick inline marks, rubric side-pane, keyboard shortcuts for speed.
* **Reports**: exportable CSVs, printable student reports, scheduled email digests.

### 19.7 Emotional UX for Children (Ages 5‚Äì14)

Children don‚Äôt engage with ‚Äúplatforms‚Äù ‚Äî they engage with **worlds, characters, and stories**.

**Core Emotional Drivers:**
- **Belonging**: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm part of the Math Explorers Guild!‚Äù
- **Mastery**: ‚ÄúI just unlocked the Algebra Badge!‚Äù
- **Autonomy**: ‚ÄúI chose to explore fractions before decimals.‚Äù
- **Purpose**: ‚ÄúMy score helps my team win the Science Cup!‚Äù

**Design Tactics:**
- **Character-led Onboarding**: A friendly guide (e.g., ‚ÄúRobo-Ravi‚Äù for India, ‚ÄúLuna‚Äù for US) walks the child through first login.
- **Celebration Micro-Animations**: Confetti, sound effects, character dances on quiz completion ‚Äî even for 60% scores. *Effort is celebrated, not just perfection.*
- **Safe Failure**: ‚ÄúOops! Let‚Äôs try again with a hint?‚Äù ‚Äî no red X‚Äôs, no public leaderboards that shame.
- **Parent-Child Rituals**: ‚ÄúWeekly Family Learning Time‚Äù prompts sent to parents: ‚ÄúPlay ‚ÄòFraction Feast‚Äô with your child tonight!‚Äù

### 19.8 The eduversity World & Avatar System

Every student inhabits the **eduversity World** ‚Äî a persistent, evolving universe where learning = exploration.

## 6. Scoring Math & Psychometrics

### 6.1 Weighted Course Score

Let there be N graded components with normalized scores $s_i\in[0,1]$ and weights $w_i$ such that $\sum_i w_i = 1$.

$\text{CourseScore} = \sum_{i=1}^N w_i \cdot s_i$

**Numeric example**: assignments (0.3):0.9, quizzes (0.2):0.75, project (0.3):0.8, participation (0.2):0.6 ‚Üí CourseScore = 0.78 (78%).

### 6.2 Item Difficulty (p-value)

$p = \frac{\text{number correct}}{\text{number attempted}}$

Flag item when $p < 0.2$ (too hard) or $p > 0.95$ (too easy).

### 6.3 Item Discrimination (point-biserial correlation)

$r_{pb} = \frac{\overline{X}_\text{high} - \overline{X}_\text{low}}{s_X} \sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}$

Where $\overline{X}_\text{high}$ and $\overline{X}_\text{low}$ are item means for top and bottom groups, $s_X$ is population std dev, $p$ proportion correct, $q = 1-p$.

### 6.4 Reliability (Cronbach's alpha)

$\alpha = \frac{K}{K-1} \left(1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^K \sigma^2_{Y_i}}{\sigma^2_X} \right)$

Where K = number of items, $\sigma^2_{Y_i}$ variance for item i, $\sigma^2_X$ variance for total test score.

### 6.5 Z-score normalization

$z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}$

Use z-scores to compare across tests with different means/variances.

---

## 7. OpenFGA ‚Äî Model & Tuples (examples)

### 7.1 Type Definitions (pseudo)

* `user`
* `course`
* `content`

### 7.2 Relations

* `instructor_of` (user -> course)
* `enrolled_in` (user -> course)
* `parent_of` (user -> user)

### 7.3 Example tuples

```
tuple: ("user:u123", "instructor_of", "course:c456")
tuple: ("user:u999", "parent_of", "user:u123")
tuple: ("user:u123", "enrolled_in", "course:c456")
```

### 7.4 Policy example (human-readable)

`can_view_grade(user, grade) = user == grade.student OR OpenFGA.is('instructor_of', user, grade.course) OR OpenFGA.is('parent_of', user, grade.student)`

---

## 8. Course Export / Import Sample

### 8.1 Course JSON Bundle (abridged)

```json
{
  "course_id": "c-2025-0001",
  "title": {"en":"Grade 3 - Fractions"},
  "modules": [
    {"id":"m1","title":"Intro to Fractions","lessons":[{"id":"l1","content_items":[{"id":"ci1","type":"text"}]}]}
  ],
  "assets": ["assets/ci1/intro.pdf","assets/app/math-safari.zip"]
}
```

**Export package**: `course.json` + `assets/` zip. Import validates references and returns a `blueprint_id`.

---

## 9. OneRoster / SIS mapping (CSV sample)

```
user_id,username,first_name,last_name,email,role,org_path,grade
u123,student1,Anu,Sharma,anu@example.com,student,school-1/class-3,3
u234,teacher1,Rahul,Sharma,rahul@example.com,teacher,school-1,3
```

Map `org_path` ‚Üí class/section. Provide dry-run validation endpoint that reports conflicts and suggestions.

---

## 10. Plugin Validation & Security Checklist

**Automated checks**

* Manifest JSON Schema valid
* Asset files present and checksums match
* Max bundle size under configured threshold
* No disallowed network hosts in manifest
* Hints of PII in static assets scanned (simple regex)
* Required message events supported

**Manual checks**

* Playtest for gameplay & learning alignment
* Accessibility smoke test
* Performance quick-run (time-to-interactive budget)
* Privacy review (data collected, retention)

**Security checks**

* CSP verifies allowed origins
* iframe sandbox uses restrictive flags
* No eval() or unsafe inline scripts in entry HTML
* Signed manifest & publisher verification for third-party apps

**Approval**

* Publish only after passing automated and manual checks; record reviewer id & timestamp.

---

## 11. Glossary & Conventions

* `app` ‚Äî interactive learning piece (Unity/WebGL or Arcade)
* `plugin` ‚Äî the app + manifest + metadata packaged for marketplace
* `blueprint` ‚Äî templated course instance
* `tenant` ‚Äî institution or customer
* **Naming**: Use `kebab-case` for manifest `id` (e.g., `edu-math-safari`).
* **Versioning**: Semantic (semver) for manifests and plugin releases.
